A substate baz of bar will be referred to as foo_bar_baz and so on. When entering a substate, enter will be called for all parent states. The same is true for exiting substates. Third, nested states can overwrite transition behaviour of their parents. If a transition is not known to the current state it will be delegated to its parent.\n",

In some cases this is not sufficient however. For instance if state names consists of more than one word and you want/need to use underscore to separate them instead of CamelCase. To deal with this, you can change the character used for separation quite easily. You can even use fancy unicode characters if you use Python 3. Setting the separator to something else than underscore changes some of the behaviour (auto_transition and setting callbacks) though:"
